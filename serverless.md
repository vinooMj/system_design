Serverless computing is an architecture and service model that enables developers to build and run applications without having to manage a server.

Of course, their code still runs on servers. The point is that developers don’t have to manage the underlying infrastructure. Instead, they simply pay for compute on a per-use basis.

Key attributes of a serverless developer platform:

• Event-based execution—The serverless infrastructure doesn’t call a function until it is triggered by an external event.
• Scales to zero/infinity—When not receiving requests, the costs for serverless compute is zero, reducing costs. When demand returns, additional instances are created and paid for as needed.
• Discrete units of code—Applications can use the serverless model to call as little as a single function.

How is serverless computing different from cloud services?

The cloud model requires developers to reserve and pay for a set amount of bandwidth or a number of servers, even if they don’t end up using them. Serverless lets devs only pay for what they use.

What are the advantages?

A serverless developer platform empowers devs to quickly create scalable and cost-effective applications without the need to build out underlying infrastructure for their code to run on. This enables builders to test ideas for minimal costs, find product-market fit faster, and scale seamlessly.
