API styles are like that. 

They're a way of asking for information from a computer. But instead of saying "Hey, can I have a chocolate chip cookie?", you
say "GET /cookies/chocolate-chip".

An API style is like a secret handshake 🤝 between two computers, helping them share and understand each other's messages.

There are different styles of handshakes, and each has its own way of sending and receiving information! 

I've simplified and decoded the secrets of 6 most important API styles for you, so you can save time and focus on what matters most! 

𝗦𝗢𝗔𝗣:

• A protocol using XML-based messages for communication
• Requires strict adherence to predefined contracts
• Operates primarily over HTTP or HTTPS
• Commonly used in enterprise environments

𝗥𝗘𝗦𝗧 𝗔𝗣𝗜:

• An architectural style focused on resources and statelessness
• Employs standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
• Easier to implement and understand compared to SOAP
• Can work with various data formats, but JSON is most common

𝗴𝗥𝗣𝗖:

• Focuses on remote procedure calls (RPCs) between services
• Uses HTTP/2 for transport and Protocol Buffers for serialization
• Ideal for microservices, where low latency and high efficiency are crucial
• Automatically generates client and server code for multiple languages
 
𝗚𝗿𝗮𝗽𝗵𝗤𝗟:

• A query language and runtime for APIs
• Allows clients to request specific data, reducing over-fetching
• Can combine multiple data sources in a single request
• Developed and open-sourced by Facebook

𝗪𝗲𝗯𝘀𝗼𝗰𝗸𝗲𝘁:

• A bidirectional, real-time communication protocol
• Maintains a single, long-lived connection over TCP
• Suitable for web applications requiring live updates
• Not tied to any specific serialization format
 
𝗪𝗲𝗯𝗵𝗼𝗼𝗸:

• A server-side, event-driven mechanism
• Sends HTTP callbacks (usually POST requests) to specified URLs
• Triggered by specific events or actions within an application
• Useful for integrating third-party services or updating data in real time
