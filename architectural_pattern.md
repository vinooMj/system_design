An architectural pattern is a general, reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem in software architecture.

Here are the most common architectural patterns:

𝟭. 𝗦𝘁𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗰 𝗖𝗼𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗻𝘁 𝗛𝗼𝘀𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴: Used to optimize webpage loading time by storing static content separately from dynamic content

𝟮. 𝗣𝗲𝗲𝗿-𝘁𝗼-𝗣𝗲𝗲𝗿: Involves multiple components called Peers, where a pear may function both as a client, requesting services from other peers, and
as a server, providing services to other peers.

𝟯. 𝗣𝘂𝗯𝗹𝗶𝘀𝗵𝗲𝗿-𝗦𝘂𝗯𝘀𝗰𝗿𝗶𝗯𝗲𝗿: Used to send (publishes) relevant messages to places that have subscribed to a topic.

𝟰. 𝗦𝗵𝗮𝗿𝗱𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗣𝗮𝘁𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗻 – Used to partition data in a database to speed commands or queries.

𝟱. 𝗖𝗶𝗿𝗰𝘂𝗶𝘁 𝗕𝗿𝗲𝗮𝗸𝗲𝗿: Helps make systems more fault tolerant by minimizing the effects of a hazard by rerouting traffic to another service.

𝟲. 𝗟𝗮𝘆𝗲𝗿𝗲𝗱 𝗣𝗮𝘁𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗻: Generally used to develop applications that include groups of subtasks that execute in a specific order.

𝟳. 𝗖𝗹𝗶𝗲𝗻𝘁-𝗦𝗲𝗿𝘃𝗲𝗿: A peer-to-peer architecture that is comprised of a client, which requests a service, and a server, which provides the
service.

𝟴. 𝗠𝗮𝘀𝘁𝗲𝗿-𝗦𝗹𝗮𝘃𝗲: Consists of two components; the master distributes the work among identical slaves and computes a final result from the 
results which the slaves return.

𝟵. 𝗣𝗶𝗽𝗲-𝗙𝗶𝗹𝘁𝗲𝗿: Used to structure systems that produce and process a stream of data.

𝟭𝟬. 𝗘𝘃𝗲𝗻𝘁-𝗗𝗿𝗶𝘃𝗲𝗻: Uses events to trigger and communicate between decoupled services.

𝟭𝟭. 𝗠𝗼𝗱𝗲𝗹-𝗩𝗶𝗲𝘄-𝗖𝗼𝗻𝘁𝗿𝗼𝗹𝗹𝗲𝗿: Divides an application into three components. The model contains the application's data and main functionality; the view displays data and interacts with the user; and the controller handles user input and acts as the mediator between the model and the view.

𝟭𝟮. 𝗜𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗽𝗿𝗲𝘁𝗲𝗿: Used to interpret a higher level language to a lower level language to execute a series of commands directly.

𝟭𝟯. 𝗠𝗶𝗰𝗿𝗼𝘀𝗲𝗿𝘃𝗶𝗰𝗲𝘀: Used to create multiple services that work interdependently to create a larger application.

𝟭𝟰. 𝗖𝗼𝗺𝗺𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗤𝘂𝗲𝗿𝘆 𝗥𝗲𝘀𝗽𝗼𝗻𝘀𝗶𝗯𝗶𝗹𝗶𝘁𝘆 𝗦𝗲𝗴𝗿𝗲𝗴𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻: Used to separate read and write activities to provide greater stability, scalability, and performance.
