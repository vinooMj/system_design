𝗥𝗮𝗯𝗯𝗶𝘁𝗠𝗤 𝘃𝘀. 𝗞𝗮𝗳𝗸𝗮 𝘃𝘀. 𝗔𝗰𝘁𝗶𝘃𝗲𝗠𝗤: 𝗧𝗼𝗽 𝟳 𝗗𝗶𝗳𝗳𝗲𝗿𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗲𝘀

🔹𝗣𝗲𝗿𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗺𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗲 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗦𝗰𝗮𝗹𝗮𝗯𝗶𝗹𝗶𝘁𝘆: Kafka is designed for high throughput and horizontal scalability, making it well-suited for handling large 
volumes of data. RabbitMQ and ActiveMQ both offer high performance, but Kafka generally outperforms them in terms of throughput, 
particularly in scenarios with high data volume.

🔹𝗠𝗲𝘀𝘀𝗮𝗴𝗲 𝗣𝗿𝗶𝗼𝗿𝗶𝘁𝘆: RabbitMQ and ActiveMQ support message prioritization, allowing messages with higher priority to be processed before 
those with lower priority. Kafka does not have built-in message priority support.

🔹𝗠𝗲𝘀𝘀𝗮𝗴𝗲 𝗢𝗿𝗱𝗲𝗿𝗶𝗻𝗴: RabbitMQ and ActiveMQ guarantee message ordering within a single queue or topic, respectively. Kafka ensures message
ordering within a partition but not across partitions within a topic.

🔹𝗠𝗲𝘀𝘀𝗮𝗴𝗲 𝗠𝗼𝗱𝗲𝗹: RabbitMQ uses a queue-based message model following the Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP), while Kafka utilizes
a distributed log-based model. ActiveMQ is built on the Java Message Service (JMS) standard and also uses a queue-based message model.

🔹𝗗𝘂𝗿𝗮𝗯𝗶𝗹𝗶𝘁𝘆: All three message brokers support durable messaging, ensuring that messages are not lost in case of failures. However, 
the mechanisms for achieving durability differ among the three, with RabbitMQ and ActiveMQ offering configurable durability options 
and Kafka providing built-in durability through log replication.

🔹𝗥𝗲𝗽𝗹𝗶𝗰𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻: RabbitMQ supports replication through Mirrored Queues, while Kafka features built-in partition replication. ActiveMQ 
uses a Primary-Replica replication mechanism.

🔹𝗦𝘁𝗿𝗲𝗮𝗺 𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗰𝗲𝘀𝘀𝗶𝗻𝗴: Kafka provides native stream processing capabilities through Kafka Streams, similarly RabbitMQ offers stream 
processing too, while ActiveMQ relies on third-party libraries for stream processing.
